           Coding involves using programming languages, like Python, Java, or C++, to create software, websites, and apps. Code is like instructions that tell the computer what tasks to perform, how to process data, and how to interact with users. Basically, coding is the language of computers, allowing humans to communicate with machines and create technology.
